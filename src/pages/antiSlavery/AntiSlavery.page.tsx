                                            <h3>Purpose of this Policy </h3>

                                            <p>
                                                ST seeks to ensure ‘best in class’ services for all Users of our website(s), including those relating to safety and security. 
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                At ST, we are committed to be part of the international effort to end modern slavery. This policy aims to inform you about that commitment and some of the various aspects we implement to achieve that goal. 
                                            </p>

                                            <p style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Our Position  </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Although ST does not have any direct relationship with Users of the site, we do provide the platform for Service Providers to advertise from, and Service Seekers to engage with Members. Accordingly, we use our best efforts to create a space where Members are free to interact with one another safely and of their own accord. We do not tolerate any activities on the site that use illegal methods for profit and/or personal gain; especially those that willingly exploit others. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                We also endeavor to act ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships, being forever mindful of the real-world consequences of modern slavery. 
                                            </p>

                                            <h3>ST Anti-Slavery Policy </h3>
                                            <p>
                                                We do not knowingly support or condone any activity relating to modern slavery on the ST site(s) and actively combat it to the best of our ability. The ST site(s) implement processes/procedures that assist us in preventing exploitative accounts being both setup and used. One of these processes is the ST Verification System, which we are unable to divulge much detail about for operational reasons, that has in-built mechanisms to identify and prevent potential victims from being exploited. If we have a reasonable suspicion that one of our Members may currently be in this situation, verification will be one of the first processes undertaken to combat exploitation. 
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                In line with our goal of mitigating and ending modern slavery in this industry sector, we employ staff to monitor the site and investigate any reports of exploitation by our Members. This monitoring and investigation take place year-round to ensure we reach a swift and effective solution. Where necessary, incidents will be raised to senior members of staff and/or Law enforcement agencies. 
                                            </p>

                                                We cooperate fully with Law enforcement agencies to assist with enquiries relating to their investigations; this includes working with the Home Office, National Crime Agency, and local UK Law enforcement bodies, i.e., county/city police forces in relation to human trafficking and modern slavery investigations.

                                                Even with the resources we dedicate to dealing with this unfortunate issue, one of the best ways to help bring instances to our attention and be dealt with is by Member reports. If you meet someone, or are talking with someone from the site and get the impression they are in a modern slavery circumstance, please see this article for some tips on who to contact.

                                                We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery of whatever form is or may be taking place in any part of our own business.
