                                                We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the lST. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with this policy and our instructions.

                                                If ever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring we use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe.

                                                We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business 'need to know'. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
                                                We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

                                            <p>
                                                We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your Personal Data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
                                                To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
                                                In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data; see your legal rights below for further information.
                                                In some circumstances we will anonymize your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
