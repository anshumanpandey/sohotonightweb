                                            <p style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>What is Sohotonight.com?</p>
                                            <p>
                                                ST is an online directory where Members can browse, interact with, and purchase digital services from Adult Service Providers. 
                                                Like many other platform providing sites, ST has no direct relationship with any of the Members using the facilities provided. We are not adult business operators but Internet Technology specialists and marketeers of online business solutions. 
                                            </p>

                                            <p style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Escorting</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Whilst ST does provide a platform for Adult Service Providers to advertise from, it is important to note that any money paid to the escorts listed on ST is for their time and companionship only and ST does not handle any monies relating to these meetings whatsoever. 
                                            </p>

                                            <p style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Adults Only </p>
                                            <p>
                                                You must be aged 18 years or over to access the ST site(s). 
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>All site pages are marked as adult content using the industry standard; Restricted To Adults (RTA) labelling. </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    All visits to the Site must go via the entry page, which removes any ambiguity about what can be found within.
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>If someone finds their way to the site without entering via the entry page, a floating pop-up with the same information is presented before the User can continue. </li>
                                                    </ul>

                                            <p>
                                                Before being able to purchase adult content on ST, Members must age verify using one of the available methods. We try to streamline this process as much as possible by attempting age verification at the point of purchasing ST Credits. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                If we discover or have any reason to suspect that you are not aged 18 years or over, we reserve the right to suspend your account until proof of age has been provided or terminate your membership to the ST site(s) immediately and without notice. 
                                            </p>

                                                Any subsequent attempt to register if you have been accessing the ST site(s) while under-age, even when 18 years of age, will also be denied.

Every country has its own rules and regulations regarding sex work, the advertising of it and what acts or depictions are permissible in content that is delivered online. The onus for ensuring legal conduct must be with the Member. What is legal for one, may not be legal for another. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                ST does moderate content on the site to ensure its legality and conformance with the Site's User Agreement; however, it is your responsibility as a producer or consumer of content to conform with the laws of your country. If in doubt, you should consult independent legal advice.

                                                Security and privacy are a key concern for our Users and ST treat that accordingly, we keep these concerns as one of the forefront considerations in our decision-making process. 
                                                ST has invested considerably in security hardware, software and protocols to ensure all Member information remains secure. Regular testing is performed to ensure the entry points to the platform are secured appropriately.

                                                ST continually reviews and updates protocols and procedures to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we understand the need for data protection, especially in this industry, and endeavor to keep our Users' data secure at all times.

                                                ST wants all of our Members to be safe and well which is why we have developed various features that give Members insight and information that allows them to make informed decisions, such as the feedback/rating system. 
                                                Unfortunately, no internet-based advertising platform is risk free and without disingenuous advertisers. As ST is simply the platform provider, we encourage a buyer beware policy when evaluating any advertisement or offer. 
                                                ST maintains a directory of Support Services for our Service Providers but anyone needing support can simply search for "sex worker support" or "sexual health services" and we would encourage you to do so. 
                                                ST regularly contribute to surveys1 and initiatives that support Adult Service Providers and victims of trafficking and exploitation. 
                                                Surveys and research projects that ST contribute data to use Aggregated and/or Anonymized Data only, this means it cannot be used to personally identify you. Find out more information from us Privacy Policy.

                                            <p>
                                                As of November 1, 2020, due to the demands of regulation and compliance, the Sohotonight.com business moved into Europe and now trades from Cyprus. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Whilst there are several painful burdens on the operators of the ST site(s), there are also knock-on effects for our valued membership. The most significant of these being, in accordance with EU law, we now need to charge ‘Place of Supply VAT’ in many places where previously we did not. This applies to all Member types; we have setup specific information pages for both Service Providers and Service Seekers for further details. 
                                            </p>
